During the first task, I encountered several challenges. 

The main issue was that I needed a new computer, which I resolved by replacing the old one. 

However, I faced another obstacle - time. 
As a full-time mom, finding time for personal projects is difficult, especially without much support apart from my husband. 

This made it really tough to complete the project. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it properly, and the deliverables didn't meet all the requirements. 
I put in a lot of effort and focus, both physically and mentally. It was a challenging experience, but I believe I can do better. 
The Bootcamp training has partially addressed this problem, so I'm putting all my efforts into it :)
